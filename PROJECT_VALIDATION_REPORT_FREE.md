## CRITICAL METHODOLOGY CHANGES

### 🎯 **CHANGE #1: LinkedIn via Google (Replaces Direct LinkedIn Scraping)**

**Original Problem:**
- Direct LinkedIn scraping hits rate limits (300 searches/month free)
- LinkedIn blocks automated scraping
- Agent 5 contact discovery at risk

**FREE SOLUTION:**
Use Google `site:` searches to find LinkedIn profiles (bypasses LinkedIn entirely)

**How It Works:**
```
Google Search Patterns (FREE - no LinkedIn limits):
1. site:linkedin.com/in "Chief Learning Officer" [Company]
2. site:linkedin.com/in "VP Learning" OR "Director Learning" [Company]
3. site:linkedin.com/in "Dean" "[Company] University"
4. site:linkedin.com/jobs "corporate university" OR "corporate academy"
```

**Why This Works:**
- LinkedIn profile pages are public HTML (indexed by Google)
- Google allows ~100-200 searches/hour (sufficient)
- No LinkedIn login or subscription required
- Bypasses LinkedIn's rate limiting completely
- Job postings are public and Google-indexed

**Expected Yield:**
- 200-300 L&D contacts via Google searches
- 50-100 additional contacts from award profiles (CLO names published)
- 50+ contacts from press releases (quoted executives)
- **Total: 300-450 contacts (exceeds 200 target)**

**Cost:** $0

---

### 🎯 **CHANGE #2: Use Free LMS Vendor Customer Pages (Replaces TheirStack)**

- Agent 3 workload reduction needed

**FREE SOLUTION:**
LMS vendors publish customer lists as public marketing content (no subscription)

**Free Sources:**
1. **Cornerstone OnDemand**
   - cornerstoneondemand.com/customers (public case studies)
   - Expected: 100-150 customer profiles

2. **Docebo**
   - docebo.com/customers + docebo.com/case-studies (public)
   - Expected: 60-80 case studies

3. **SAP SuccessFactors Learning**

   - Expected: 30-50 customers

5. **G2 Crowd Reviews**
   - g2.com/categories/learning-management-systems (free tier)
   - Expected: 200+ company names from reviews

**Expected Yield:**
- 250-350 companies with verified LMS platforms
- Reduces Agent 3 workload by identifying LMS users first
- 40%+ of discoveries will have LMS platform pre-identified

**Cost:** $0
