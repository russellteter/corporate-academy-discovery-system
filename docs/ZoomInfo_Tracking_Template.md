## Google Sheets Formula Helpers

### **Cell Formulas for Tracking**

**Running Total (Column F):**
```
=IF(B2="ZoomInfo", IF(ROW()=2, E2, F1+E2), "")
```
- Only calculates for ZoomInfo entries
- First ZoomInfo row: uses API_Calls_Used directly
- Subsequent rows: adds to previous running total

**Remaining Budget (Column G):**
```
=IF(B2="ZoomInfo", 250000-F2, "")
```
- Subtracts running total from project budget (250,000)

**Conditional Formatting Rules:**

**1. Green Status (Remaining_Budget > 50,000):**
- Range: G2:G1000
- Format: Light green background (#D9EAD3)
- Condition: `=$G2 > 50000`

**2. Yellow Status (Remaining_Budget 25,000-50,000):**
- Range: G2:G1000
- Format: Yellow background (#FFF2CC)
- Condition: `=AND($G2 >= 25000, $G2 <= 50000)`

**3. Red Status (Remaining_Budget < 25,000):**
- Range: G2:G1000
- Format: Red background (#F4CCCC)
- Condition: `=$G2 < 25000`

**4. Alert on High Usage (API_Calls_Used > 5,000):**
- Range: E2:E1000
- Format: Orange background (#FCE5CD)
- Condition: `=AND($B2="ZoomInfo", $E2 > 5000)`

## Dashboard Summary (Separate Sheet Tab)

### **ZoomInfo_Dashboard Sheet Structure**

**Key Metrics Section:**

| Metric | Formula | Display Format |

| **Total API Calls Used** | `=SUMIF(Processing_Log!B:B,"ZoomInfo",Processing_Log!E:E)` | 125,450 calls |
| **Project Budget** | `250000` | 250,000 calls |
| **Remaining Budget** | `=250000-[Total API Calls]` | 124,550 calls |
| **Budget Used (%)** | `=[Total API Calls]/250000*100` | 50.2% |
| **Status** | `=IF([Budget Used]<60,"GREEN",IF([Budget Used]<80,"YELLOW","RED"))` | GREEN |

**Usage by Tool:**

| Tool Name | Operations | API Calls | Records |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| lookup | `=COUNTIFS(Processing_Log!B:B,"ZoomInfo",Processing_Log!C:C,"lookup")` | `=SUMIFS(Processing_Log!E:E,Processing_Log!B:B,"ZoomInfo",Processing_Log!C:C,"lookup")` | `=SUMIFS(Processing_Log!D:D,Processing_Log!B:B,"ZoomInfo",Processing_Log!C:C,"lookup")` |

  "SELECT B, COUNT(C), SUM(E), SUM(D)
   WHERE B = 'ZoomInfo'
   GROUP BY B
   LABEL COUNT(C) 'Operations', SUM(E) 'API Calls', SUM(D) 'Records'")
```

**Daily Usage Chart:**

## Pre-Flight Check Template

**Before ANY ZoomInfo operation, use this checklist:**

### **1. Budget Verification**

```
Current Status:
- Running Total: [Get from last Processing_Log entry, Column F]
- Remaining Budget: [Get from last Processing_Log entry, Column G]
- Status: [Calculate: <60% = GREEN, 60-80% = YELLOW, >80% = RED]

Planned Operation:
- Tool: [lookup / search_contacts / enrich_contact / etc.]
- Estimated API Calls: [Calculate based on API Call Estimation Guide]
- Records to Process: [Number of contacts/companies]

Budget Check:
- After Operation Total: [Running Total] + [Estimated Calls] = ?
- Remaining After: 250000 - [After Operation Total] = ?
- Percentage Used: [After Operation Total] / 250000 * 100 = ?%

DECISION:
[ ] PROCEED - Budget sufficient, operation approved
[ ] REVIEW - Approaching 80%, discuss with user
[ ] ABORT - Insufficient budget, revise approach
```

### **2. Free Source Check**

```
Before using ZoomInfo, verify free sources exhausted:

For Contact Enrichment:
[ ] Checked LinkedIn via Google (site:linkedin.com/in)
[ ] Checked awards programs (Brandon Hall, Training Top 125, etc.)
[ ] Checked press releases (PR Newswire, Business Wire)
[ ] Checked company website careers/leadership pages

For Company Validation:
[ ] Checked company website About/Leadership pages
[ ] Checked LinkedIn company page
[ ] Checked Crunchbase/public databases
[ ] Checked SEC filings (if public company)

For Tech Stack Discovery:
[ ] Checked LMS vendor customer pages
[ ] Checked company job postings (tech requirements)
[ ] Checked LinkedIn job descriptions
[ ] Checked company press releases

DECISION:
[ ] FREE SOURCES EXHAUSTED - ZoomInfo approved
[ ] FREE SOURCES AVAILABLE - Use those first
```

### **3. Operation Logging Template**

```python
# After ZoomInfo operation completes
operation_log = {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-28T14:30:15",
    "agent_name": "ZoomInfo",
    "tool_name": "enrich_contact",  # or search_contacts, enrich_company, etc.
    "records_affected": 10,          # Number of contacts/companies
    "api_calls_used": 1,             # Actual API calls consumed
    "running_total": 12450,          # Previous total + this operation
    "remaining_budget": 237550,      # 250000 - running_total
    "operation_notes": "Batch 1/20: Enriched Agent 5 LinkedIn contacts with email/phone"
}

# Write to Processing_Log sheet
add_rows(spreadsheet_id, "Processing_Log", [[
    operation_log["timestamp"],
    operation_log["agent_name"],
    operation_log["tool_name"],
    operation_log["records_affected"],
    operation_log["api_calls_used"],
    operation_log["running_total"],
    operation_log["remaining_budget"],
    operation_log["operation_notes"]
]])

# Alert if approaching limits
if operation_log["running_total"] >= 200000:
    print("üö® CRITICAL: 80%+ of budget used - Review with user!")
elif operation_log["running_total"] >= 175000:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: 70%+ of budget used - Monitor closely")
```
